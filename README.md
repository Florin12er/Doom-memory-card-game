# This is a Doom memory card Game:
## How I am going to build the app: 

- Define the title add a score and best score and add the cards  
- make a logic for when I press a card it adds one point to the 
score but if the card has been already press then restart the game
- add a logic to define the best score
- add game logic
- add a logic when I press a card the position of the card randomize: 
have a base state and modify to random state when a card is pressed.

## Components: 
 - card Component
 - Title and rules Component
 - Score Component
 - the cards should have their own separate key
 
## Hooks:

- useState and useEffect for card randomizing
- useState for score

## Style:
- have all the cards in one class to use grid layout
- have the titles separate of the cards class
